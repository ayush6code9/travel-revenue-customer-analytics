#  Travel Booking Platform – Product & Revenue Analytics

##  Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **product and revenue analytics case study** for a travel booking platform. It analyzes customer demographics, booking behavior, pricing, discounts, subscriptions, and trip patterns to generate actionable insights that support **revenue growth, customer retention, and booking conversion optimization**.

The project follows a real-world analytics workflow using **Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI**, similar to how data analysts and product teams operate in industry.

##  Business Problem
The travel booking platform collects large volumes of customer, booking, and transaction data but lacks clear visibility into:
- High-value customers
- Pricing and discount effectiveness
- Subscription adoption and loyalty patterns
- Repeat booking behavior and churn risk
- Destination and travel-category performance

**Core Question:**  
How can a travel booking platform leverage customer and transaction data to optimize pricing, improve retention, and drive long-term revenue growth?

---

##  Key Business Questions Addressed
- What is the total revenue generated by different customer segments?
- Do subscribed users spend more than non-subscribers?
- Which users remain high-value even after using discounts?
- Which destinations and travel categories drive the highest revenue?
- Are frequent travelers more likely to become subscribers?
- How does revenue contribution vary across age groups?

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – data cleaning & feature engineering  
- **PostgreSQL** – business analysis using CTEs, aggregations, and window functions  
- **Power BI** – interactive dashboards and KPI visualization  
- **GitHub** – version control and project documentation

##  Key Insights
- Subscribers show higher average spend and stronger loyalty than non-subscribers.
- Frequent travelers are more likely to purchase premium packages.
- Discounts increase booking volume but reduce average booking value, highlighting margin risks.
- Honeymoon and Business travel categories generate the highest revenue.
- Certain destinations consistently outperform in both revenue and customer ratings.

##  Dashboard & Reporting
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was created to visualize:
- Revenue drivers
- Customer segmentation
- Subscription and premium package performance
- Destination and travel-category insights


---

## Business Recommendations
- Target frequent and loyal travelers with subscription and premium upsell campaigns.
- Reduce blanket discounting and move toward personalized offers.
- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing destinations.
- Strengthen retention strategies for high lifetime value customer segments.
